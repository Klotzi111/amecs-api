# Amecs API (or Amecs' API)

This library mod provides modifier keys for Minecraft keybindings as well as some related keybinding utility classes

## Usage
 If you're not a modder you're probably looking for [Amecs](https://github.com/Siphalor/amecs).
 
 If you **are** a modder then you can use Amecs with the following in your build.gradle:
 
 ```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://maven.siphalor.de/"
        name "Siphalor's Maven"
    }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "de.siphalor:amecsapi-1.15:1+"
    include "de.siphalor:amecsapi-1.15:1+"
}
```

Have fun ;)
