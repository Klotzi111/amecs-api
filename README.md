# Amecs API (or Amecs' API)

This library mod provides modifier keys for Minecraft keybindings as well as some related keybinding utility classes

## Usage
 If you're not a modder you're probably looking for [Amecs](https://github.com/Klotzi111/amecs).
 
 If you **are** a modder then you can use Amecs with the following in your build.gradle:
 
```groovy
repositories {
	maven {
		url "https://jitpack.io"
	}
}

dependencies {
	include(modApi("com.github.Klotzi111:amecs-api:multiversion-SNAPSHOT"))
}
```

Have fun ;)
